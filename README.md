# GetACookie 🍪

## 🌟 Overview
**GetACookie** is a project developed to learn and master the Django framework in Python. The project involves creating a simple web application that randomly generates fortune cookie messages when the user accesses the dedicated page.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Django** 🌐
- **HTML/CSS** 🎨 (for basic layout)

## 📚 Project Objectives
The main goal of this project was to:
- Install and configure a Django project.
- Work with Django's URL routing and views system.
- Manage templates to display dynamic content.

By developing **GetACookie**, the focus was on understanding Django's internal workings, particularly:
- Creating and routing URLs.
- Developing views to handle HTTP requests.
- Integrating models and templates to display messages dynamically.

## 🎨 Features
- **Fortune Cookie Generator**: When the user accesses the main page, a fortune cookie message is generated and displayed randomly.
- **Routing System**: Utilizes Django's URL routing system to direct users to the main page.
- **Dynamic Template**: Integrates fortune messages through a Django template.

## 🚧 Challenges
The main challenge was understanding Django's URL and view systems. Manipulating templates to display a message dynamically also required a solid grasp of Django's fundamental concepts.
